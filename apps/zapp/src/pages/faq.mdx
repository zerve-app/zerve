### What is the [Open Source Code] Moratorium?

Zerve Code is Open Sourced 7 days after the changes land in the main branch.

### What license do you get if you subscribe?

You get the full open source license to source code under the moratorium. Legally this means you have permission to re-publish the code publicly.

We ask you not to share the code publicly until the 7-day moratorium is passed.

### What happens if a subscriber re-publishes code publicly before the moratorium is over?

Although this is legal for a subscriber to do under the open source license, this will impair our ability acquire subscribers and fund Zerve.

If we find a subscriber regularly or blatantly doing this, we will end their membership immediately.
