title: Zerve Boosted
---

Boosted is a real-world starter for your next web project.

## Motivation

To build a SaaS, you always have to start by choosing a set of tools, and then glue them together. This takes a lot of time and effort!

Boosted is a complete SaaS that you can use as a starting point for your next project. It's built with the ZStack, a curated set of technologies that we love at Zerve.

Useful beyond the starting point: New features are always being added to Boosted, and you can merge in features and fixes over time.

## Pricing / Availability

The latest version of Boosted is available for all [Zerve subscribers](/pricing) (starting at $12.5/mo).

Boosted is Open Source on a 7-day delay. Last week's code is Open Source [here on GitHub](https://github.com) under the Apache 2.0 License.

Subscribers get access to the full open source license on the main branch (no need to call the lawyers!) Plus, Subscribers have access to exclusive content and community support.

With your support, Zerve will remain committed to the Open Source community.

## ZStack

This tech stack is incomplete and evolving, but it is ready for real-world production SaaS apps.

ZStack is largely based on [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg), but it is more opinionated, and it taps in Tamagui instead of Tailwind.

- Typescript
- React
- Next.js
- React Native Web
- Tamagui
- Next Auth
- Prisma
- Zod
- TRPC
- Tanstack Query
- Postgres
- Prettier, ESLint, VSCode

Dedicated to the React Community. Inspired by [T3 App](https://create.t3.gg/), [Bedrock](https://bedrock.mxstbr.com/), and [Tamagui](https://tamgui.dev), among others.
