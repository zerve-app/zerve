title: Env Variables
---

Env Variables allow you to pass secrets and configuration into your app.

This guide will show an env variable can be added

### Use Case: Secrets

A common use case for secret env variables is API keys to connect to other services

### Use Case: Configuration

Env variables may also be used for configuring one app in another context.

## Adding Env Variables

For our example, we will add a secret API key for Stripe.

### 1. Edit Schema

Boosted apps use a Zod schema to validate the environment variables when the app starts up.

The schema is located at `apps/zapp/src/env/schema.mjs`

### 2. Add Variable Locally

Edit your `.env` file to add the variable for your local development.

### 3. Add Variable Production

Add the variable in the settings of your production environment

### 4. Use Variable

Consume the variable from your server code:

```ts
import { env } from 'src/env/server.mjs'

... new Stripe(env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, { ...
```

And now your Stripe API key is fully set up!

## Public Env Variables

A public env variable is one that is safe to expose to the client.

To add a public env variable, modify the "clientSchema" section of the schema file. Each public variable must be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` for Next to allow the client to see it.

```ts
export const clientSchema = z.object({
  NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDIA_HOST: z.string(),
  ...
```

> Note: Also add your public variable to the `clientEnv` at the bottom, or else type safety will break

Then your variable may be accessed on the client side:

```ts
import { env } from '/apps/zapp/src/env/client.mjs'

env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDIA_HOST
```
