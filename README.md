# Zerve

An experimental structured knowledge app for React Native and the web.

## Web App

`yarn dev` will spawn the following:

- API Server in "apps/server" (`yarn workspace z-server dev`)
- Next Web App "apps/web" (`yarn workspace z-web dev`)

## Mobile (Expo) App

Run the native app within `apps/mobile/ios` or `apps/mobile/android`

Then start the server with `yarn dev:mobile` or `yarn workspace z-mobile start`
