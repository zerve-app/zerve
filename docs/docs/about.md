Founded by Eric Vicenti a Software Developer and Entrepreneur from California. With over 10 years of professional software engineering experience, Eric has helped build and launch several successful Open Source projects, including [React Navigation](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation), [Docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus), and [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native).

### Lean Startup

Zerve is a lean startup, currently on a path to become profitable without raising money.

Once we are ready for explosive growth, we may raise money from investors who are aligned with a sustainable Open Source business methodology.

### Open Source

To enable a sustainable ecosystem, Zerve is entirely open source under a permissive license ([Apache 2.0](https://github.com/zerve-app/zerve/blob/main/LICENSE.md)).

In the long-term interest of the community, Eric aims to avoid proprietary business models, open core, and copyleft licenses.

### Business Model

Zerve aims to be a sustainable Open Source business. This may be supported by a variety of business models, but the first approach is a paid hosted service offering.

The paid service will launch early next year. Until that point, a free alpha service will be available to lower the barrier of entry for early adopters.

This approach should work well until large cloud providers jump in and commoditize the hosted service space. This will be healthy for the community but may jeopradize the profitibilty of the startup. At that point Zerve can utilize the brand recognition to move on to other business models.
