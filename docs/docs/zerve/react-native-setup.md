title: React Native Setup
---

This guide walks through the setup of Zerve in a React Native app.

See the full example code here, which you can use as a starter instead of following this walkthrough.

## Create App

This guide uses [Expo](https://expo.dev), but after this step it will work identically in any React Native app.

```
npx create-expo-app example-expo
```

## TS Setup

`yarn add -D typescript @types/react @types/react-native`

## Coming Soon

Same steps as described in [Zerve Workflow](../workflow).
