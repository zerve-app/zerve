## Stores

Stores are the basic unit of storage in the Zerve Content system. You can think of a store like a "database" or a "repository" for your content.

Create a store by logging in to the service, then go into your account home and tap "Create Store" under the "Personal Stores" section. Or you may create an organization and make a store within a team workspace.

## Store Entries

Entries are like "files" within a store. Create one by going into a store and pressing "Create Entry"

Then set a schema for your new entry (the default schema is blank).

All Zerve schemas are built on [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/), a standard data structure for describing JSON. From the dropdown you can choose a schema like "Text", "Number", "Object", or "List". Then use the form to refine your definition.

## Store Schemas

Schemas are re-usable data structures for multiple entries in your Store.

Tap into "Schemas" within your store and press "Create Schema".

Complex data structures can be built by combining several Store Schemas.
